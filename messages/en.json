        "question": "Is it safe to eat food shared through Barcha?",
        "answer": "Food safety is our top priority. We encourage all users to follow basic food safety guidelines: only share food that you would eat yourself, clearly indicate expiry dates, and use proper storage. However, users are responsible for their own judgment when accepting food."
      },
      "howToKnowGood": {
        "question": "How do I know if food is still good?",
        "answer": "Always check the expiry date and use your senses - look for any signs of spoilage like unusual smell, color changes, or texture. When in doubt, don't consume the food. Trust your instincts and prioritize safety."
      },

        "question": "What types of food can I share?",

      "pickupProcess": {
        "question": "How does the pickup process work?",

      "cantPickup": {
        "question": "What should I do if I can't pick up food I requested?",

      },
      "businessFood": {
        "question": "Can I share food from my restaurant or business?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and other food businesses are welcome to share their surplus food. This is a great way to reduce waste and support your local community."
      },
      "privacy": {
        "question": "How can I ensure my privacy?",

      },
      "badExperience": {
        "question": "What if I have a bad experience with someone?",
