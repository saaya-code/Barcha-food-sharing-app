  {
    question: "What is Barsha?",
    answer: "Barsha is a community-driven platform that connects people who have surplus food with those who can use it. Our mission is to reduce food waste while helping build stronger communities across Tunisia."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to eat food shared through Barsha?",
    answer: "Food safety is our top priority. We encourage all users to follow basic food safety guidelines: only share food that you would eat yourself, clearly indicate expiry dates, and use proper storage. However, users are responsible for their own judgment when accepting food."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if food is still good?",
    answer: "Always check the expiry date and use your senses - look for any signs of spoilage like unusual smell, color changes, or texture. When in doubt, don't consume the food. Trust your instincts and prioritize safety."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of food can I share?",
    answer: "You can share most types of food including baked goods, fruits, vegetables, cooked meals, and packaged items. Please be honest about the food's condition and how long it's been prepared or opened."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the pickup process work?",
    answer: "Once you request an item, you'll receive the donor's contact information. Coordinate directly with them to arrange pickup time and location. Be respectful of their time and follow any pickup instructions they've provided."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Barsha free to use?",
    answer: "Yes! Barsha is completely free for all users. We believe that sharing food and reducing waste should be accessible to everyone in our community."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if I can't pick up food I requested?",
    answer: "Please contact the donor as soon as possible to let them know. This allows them to offer the food to someone else and helps maintain trust in our community."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share food from my restaurant or business?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and other food businesses are welcome to share their surplus food. This is a great way to reduce waste and support your local community."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I ensure my privacy?",
    answer: "You control what contact information you share. You can choose to provide a phone number, WhatsApp, or email. We recommend meeting in public places for pickup when possible."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have a bad experience with someone?",
    answer: "If you encounter any issues, please let us know. We're committed to maintaining a positive and respectful community. Serious violations of our community guidelines may result in account restrictions."
